# MapReduce_Go
A lightweight distributed MapReduce system implemented in Go using only the standard library. It features a master/worker architecture with simulated failures and a live dashboard to monitor task progress. The default application performs a word count across multiple text files with intermediate and final results saved in JSON format.
